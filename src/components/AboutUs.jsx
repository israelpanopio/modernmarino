          <p>
            Modern Marino is a social media platform for seafarers based on the
            Philippines, but also caters to a worldwide audience. We create
            content that reflects the true life of seafarers at sea without that
            sugar coated drama, and cries for pity. We believe that seafaring is
            a well-respected and rewarding profession. We started out as a page
            on Facebook, and we are currently creating content for our website
            and our Youtube channel. We believe that as seafarers, we have the
            right to fight the stereotypes associated with our profession and
            make the world see that we are more than just workers at sea. We are
            talented individuals with potentials that are not hindered by our
            profession. Most seafarer sticks to the seafaring life until old
            age, and some make it a stepping stone to another venture. It is one
            of our advocacy to provide content to sharpen the seafarerâ€™s
            financial literacy to be able to have the freedom to live any kind
            of life that want for them and their families. seaman
            marinoUltimately, we are making a community where positivity towards
            seafaring is held dear. A community where one never sees themselves
            less than they are because they are seafarers. An online community
            where we can showcase the talent and wit of our fellow seafarers.Our
            online presence is wholesome and different. We do not associate with
            other seafarer pages in the Philippines where they only aim to
            gather a larger following, even going to the point where they post
            inappropriate content which stains the image of seafarers. Thank you
            for your time with us! We aim to provide you contents as we grow as
            a community. Follow us on Facebook and Youtube! Mabuhay ang
            #modernmarino!
